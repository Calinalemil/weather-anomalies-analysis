🌡️ Weather Anomalies Analysis

Author: Carolina Leiva Villamil
Tools: Python, Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib

📌 Overview

This project explores temperature anomalies in 2013 using Python-based exploratory data analysis (EDA).
The goal is to examine how temperature anomalies vary through the year and across locations, using foundational data science techniques.

This notebook was originally developed during a Stanford Data Science workshop and refined for academic and portfolio purposes.

📈 Data Preparation

The analysis includes:

Loading and inspecting the dataset

Parsing and extracting date features (year, month)

Handling missing or inconsistent values

Preparing the dataset for analysis

Note: The dataset comes from a public weather anomalies resource used in a Stanford workshop.
It is accessed directly from the source URL rather than stored in this repository.

📊 Exploratory Data Analysis

The notebook examines:

1. Distribution of Temperature Anomalies

Visualizations show how anomalies are distributed across station records.

Highlights patterns of extreme deviations and common ranges.

2. Monthly Temperature Anomaly Patterns (2013)

Evaluates how average temperature anomalies change month-to-month.

Reveals seasonal patterns and variability.

3. Station-Level Behavior

Compares patterns across locations.

Shows how temperature anomalies vary depending on the station's context.

🔍 Key Insights

The dataset contains only one year (2013), so long-term trends cannot be inferred.

Temperature anomalies vary significantly across stations, with some showing more extreme deviations.

Seasonal patterns emerge clearly in the monthly averages.

Demonstrates practical skills in data cleaning, transformation, visualization, and EDA.
